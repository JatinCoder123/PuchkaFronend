            At Puchka Paradise, weâ€™re passionate about bringing the irresistible
            flavors of Indian street food to your plate. What started as a love
            for puchkas (also known as golgappas) has grown into a full-blown
            celebration of taste, tradition, and joy.

            Whether you're craving the spicy tang of pani puri, the crispiness
            of freshly fried snacks, or the warmth of home-style chaat, we've
            curated every bite with authenticity and love.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-[#18181b] font-bold ">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Maintaining quality and freshness in every bite, every day. Scaling
            our vision from a humble cart to a celebrated name in the street
            food space, we aspire to grow this into a beloved brand that reaches
            every corner of the city (and beyond).
